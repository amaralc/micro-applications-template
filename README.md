# WhereIsMyStuff

This is a side project meant to practice software development skills with TypeScript, Node.js and React, while delivering a real product that could help people to manage their own stuff. 

The primary use case I had in mind, was manage my books. I often lend books to friends and colleagues and later find myself asking the same question: "Where is that book again?". If WhereIsMyStuff could help me to find answers for that sort of question, than the mission was accomplished.

# TODO

In order to keep track of what should be done, the project will be managed using github projects, although for faster development, I might take notes in the [todo.md file](./docs/todo.md), in this repository.

# Commits

This repository is using husky and commitlint to organize commit messages a little bit. Configuration references came from the following references:
